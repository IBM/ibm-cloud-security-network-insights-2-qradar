# ibm-cloud-security-network-insights-2-qradar

## Scope

The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism for ingesting IBM Cloud Security Network Insights into QRadar using the Universal Cloud REST API protocol.

# Pre-Requisites

## IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud account(s) with privileges to:
1. User account to create and configure Network Insights
2. User or service account for accessing the Findings API

IBM Cloud Security Advisor Network Insights:
    Follow the guide to setup at least one Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network interface flow logs to detect any suspicious activity by using learned patterns and threat intelligence. See [Enabling Network Insights](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-advisor?topic=security-advisor-setup-network)


## QRadar
1. The Universal Cloud REST API protocol is supported on QRadar 7.3.2 or later, and you must have the QRadar Log Source Management app installed. For information on how to install the app, see Installing the QRadar Log Source Management app.
For Universal Cloud REST API protocol examples, see [GitHub samples](https://github.com/ibm-security-intelligence/IBM-QRadar-Universal-Cloud-REST-API).
2. IBM QRadar user account with privileges to create/modify log sources and create/modify DSMs.
3. Reference the [Universal Cloud REST API](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.4?topic=configuration-universal-cloud-rest-api-protocol) for additional information.

## Setup QRadar using the Universal Cloud REST API

The parameters needed to configure the Univeral Cloud Rest API require information specific to the instance of IBM Cloud Security Insights. The following information will need to be put into the Workflow Parameters. 
1. api_key: [Create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey) to generate the access token for the [Findings API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/security-advisor/findings)
2. endpoint_url: The [Endpoint URL](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/security-advisor/findings) for the desired location. Only use the FQDN and not the full URL. For example, use "us-south.secadvisor.cloud.ibm.com". Do NOT use the full URL "https://us-south.secadvisor.cloud.ibm.com/findings"
3. account_id: Go to the [Account settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/settings) page in the console to view your account ID and account type.


# QRadar Log Source Configuration
